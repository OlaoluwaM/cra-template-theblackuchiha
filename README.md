# Custom CRA template

This is my custom template for create-react-app

Use it by running
<code>npm init react-app [project-name] --template theblackuchiha</code>
<code>npx create-react-app [project-name] --template theblackuchiha</code>

## Update

I removed the eslint configurations and others and added my [optIns](https://github.com/OlaoluwaM/optIns) as a submodule. I did this because the optIn scripts provide greater flexibility in that they allow me to add and remove my custom configurations for tools like ESLint, TailwindCSS, and others.
